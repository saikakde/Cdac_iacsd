Animal Hierarchy:
Problem Statement: Create a hierarchy of animal classes. Start with a base class Animal and then create derived classes like Mammal, Bird, and Fish. Each of these derived classes should have specific properties and methods related to their respective categories of animals.

Shape Hierarchy:
Problem Statement: Design a hierarchy of shape classes. Begin with a base class Shape and then create derived classes like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Each shape should have methods for calculating area and perimeter specific to its geometry.

Employee Inheritance:
Problem Statement: Build a system for managing employees. Create a base class Employee with attributes such as name, employee ID, and salary. Then, derive classes like Manager and Developer, each with its own attributes and methods. Implement a common method, like calculate_salary(), in the base class.

Vehicle Inheritance:
Problem Statement: Develop a class hierarchy for vehicles. Start with a base class Vehicle and create derived classes like Car, Motorcycle, and Truck. Each derived class should have unique properties like the number of wheels and specific methods like start_engine().

Bank Account Inheritance:
Problem Statement: Design a system for managing bank accounts. Create a base class BankAccount with attributes like account number and balance. Derive classes like SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount, each with specialized methods like withdraw() and calculate_interest().

Geometric Shapes with Polymorphism:
Problem Statement: Extend the shape hierarchy example by implementing polymorphism. Define a base class Shape with methods to calculate area and perimeter. Then, create derived classes like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle, each with its own implementation of these methods.

Person and Student Inheritance:
Problem Statement: Model a system for handling individuals and students within an educational institution. Create a base class Person with attributes like name and age. Derive a Student class with additional attributes like student ID and GPA, inheriting the common attributes from the Person class.

Library Catalog with Books and Journals:
Problem Statement: Build a library catalog system. Create a base class LibraryItem with properties like title and author. Then, derive classes like Book and Journal, each with their unique properties. Implement methods to check out and return items in the derived classes.

Shape Sorting with Interfaces:
Problem Statement: Implement a shape sorting program. Define a base class Shape with properties like area and perimeter. Create derived classes like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Implement an interface Sortable with a method to compare shapes by area. Use this interface to sort a list of shapes.

Employee Payroll System with Abstract Classes:
Problem Statement: Design an employee payroll system. Create an abstract class Employee with attributes like name and employee ID. Derive concrete classes like HourlyEmployee and SalariedEmployee. Define abstract methods for calculating pay in the base class and implement them in the derived classes.

These examples illustrate how inheritance can be used to model real-world hierarchies and relationships in object-oriented programming, promoting code reusability and organization. They also highlight various concepts like polymorphism, interfaces, and abstract classes to solve specific programming challenges.
